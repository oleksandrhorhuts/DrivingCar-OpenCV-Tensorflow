## Miniflow

Naive recreation of the core functionality of TensorFlow

### Project structure
* **miniflow.py**: Implementation of:
    * The different nodes (Input, Linear Transform, Sigmoid Activation Function and MSE) of the Computational Graph
    * Thin wrapper to ensure the connectivity of the nodes and edges
    * Forward and backward propgation mechanisms, and,
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent
* **nn.py**: Creates a 2 layer NN and trains a Linear Regression Model over the Boston Housing dataset using backprop and stochastic gradient descent to predict housing prices.
