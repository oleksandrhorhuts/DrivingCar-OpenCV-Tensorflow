## Introduction

In this project, I developed a model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. The model was trained and validated using images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/). After the model was trained, it's performance was evaulated on random traffic sign images found on the web.

My final model results are as follows:
* Training set accuracy of 97.5%
* Validation set accuracy of  98.5% 
* Test set accuracy of 97.2%
* New Test set accuracy of 100% (6 new images)
